2. Style sliders: What writing style do you want?

Irrespective of topic and spin, two sliders let you choose your preferred writing style. The nuance slider ranges from inflammatory writing with crass low-blows, ad-hominem attacks, and deliberately ugly photos of criticized people, to nuanced writing in a more respectful style. The depth slider ranges from short breezy pieces with unsubstantiated claims to in-depth coverage/analysis/expose providing good context, careful sourcing, and often detailed numbers/graphics and a more academic style.
